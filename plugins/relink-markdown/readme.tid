Markdown support for Relink.

...or Relink support for Markdown.

This supplimental plugin allows ''text/x-markdown'' files to be relinked. This means markdown linking syntax like `[Caption](#MyTiddler)` is supported. If your markdown supports wikitext markup as well, this will handle that too.

This plugin is designed for `tiddlywiki/markdown`, but it will also work for `anstosa/tw5-markdown` and others.
