When renaming a tiddler, Relink can update the fields, filters, and widgets
of all other tiddlers. However, it works through whitelisting.

It's already configured to update tiddler titles for all core widgets, filters,
and fields, but the whitelists can be customized for each of this in the
configuration panel.

See <a href={{$:/plugins/flibbles/relink!!source}}>the tw5-relink website</a> for more details and examples.
