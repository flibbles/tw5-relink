title: $:/plugins/flibbles/relink-titles/language/Lookup/Description

This option updates all configuration tiddlers which relate to target tiddlers either through fixed prefixes or suffixes, i.e. `$:/config/Buttons/Visibility/fromFile` becomes `$:/config/Buttons/Visibility/toFile` when "fromFile" is renamed.

Each line corresponds to a pattern, where `$(currentTiddler)$` would be the name of the tiddler being renamed, and `$(*)$` matches with anything.
