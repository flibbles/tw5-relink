When renaming a target tiddler, this options will make //Relink// change the titles of all tiddlers that would be considered children of the target tiddler.

For instance, renaming `Images` to `Pictures` would rename `Images/2019` to `Pictures/2019`, and `Images/2019/Trip-to-Spain` to `Pictures/2019/Trip-to-Spain`
