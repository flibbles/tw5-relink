Caption: Titles
Custom/Caption: Custom
Directory/Caption: Rename subdirectories
Directory/Description: For wikis set up hierarchically using `/`, like a filesystem. This option will update all tiddlers nested inside the target tiddler. i.e. `fromTiddler/path/file` becomes `toTiddler/path/file`.
Prefix/Caption: prefix for $:/prefix
Help: See the <a href={{{ [{$:/plugins/flibbles/relink-titles!!demo}addsuffix[#Plugins/Titles]] }}}>//Relink-titles// documentation page</a> for details.
Hint: The variables `fromTiddler` and `toTiddler` are defined as what the triggering relinked tiddler was and will be called.
Warning: ''Warning:'' This filter appears unsafe. It seems to indiscriminately change tiddlers into ''<$text text=<<erroneousTiddler>> />'', and it will probably be thrown out.
