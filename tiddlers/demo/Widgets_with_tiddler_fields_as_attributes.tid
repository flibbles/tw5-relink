title: Widgets with tiddler fields as attributes

//Relink// has a whitelist which allows you to individually specify widget attributes which should be relinked. [[That's described here.|Attributes]] However, some widgets accept attributes which correspond to tiddler fields. For instance, the ``<$action-setfield>`` widget can accept any attribute without a `$` prefix, and those attributes will become fields in the specified tiddler.

```
<$action-setfield tags="Documentation" />
```

This will set the `tags` field of the current tiddler to `Documentation`.

Because widgets like these accept a dynamic set of attributes, the attribute whitelist cannot be used to relink those fields. That's where the //fieldwidgets// settings come in. For each widget, a regular expression can be defined which specifies how its attributes correspond to tiddler fields. For `<$action-setfield>`:

```
title: $:/config/flibbles/relink/fieldwidgets/$action-setfield

([^$].*)
```

In other words, for all attributes that don't start with a `$`, look up the corresponding entry in the [[Fields]] whitelist for tiddler fields. This way, if `tags` field is configured to be relinked (which it is by default), then `<$action-setfield tags="fromTitle" />` will be relinked appropriately.

!!! The regular expression

The regular expression used must have a single capture group which will corresponds to the actual name of the tiddler field. An expression like `field-(.*)` will match the attribute `field-tags` to the `tags` tiddler field.

!!! Existing cases

The following widgets are already configured. There is no table in the //Relink// whitelists because this is such an esoteric problem, but your plugins can always add more with additional `$:/config/flibbles/relink/fieldwidgets/` tiddlers.

<table>
<$list filter="[all[shadows+tiddlers]prefix[$:/config/flibbles/relink/fieldwidgets/]]"><tr><td>''<$text text={{!!title}} />''</td><td><$text text={{!!text}} /></td></tr></$list>
</table>
