title: Migration to V2

For V2, //Relink// needed to create the `report` method to scan tiddlers for references to all other titles, not just the one being relinked at the time. This impacts the following modules and plugins

<$macrocall $name="tabs"
	tabsList="[[Migration to V2]tagging[]]"
	default="Migration to V2/relinkoperator"
	explicitState='$:/state/tab/relink/Migration to V2'
/>
