description: <p>Filters in whitelisted fields and attributes will be updated as well. However, Relink only updates the operands of whitelisted filter operators. This includes `tag` and `title`, but you can add or remove any operators you want to the list.</p><p>''Note'': Indirect operands are always updated, since regardless of their operator, they may reference tiddlers.</p>
