description: Whitelisted tiddler fields are updated just as well. Without this plugin, Tiddlywiki could manage `list` and `tags` on its own. ''Relink'' opens the door for other tiddlers, including ones that specify something other than a string list, like a filter, or a single tiddler title.
example-single: Frodo
example-list: Relink Frodo BilboBaggins
example-filter: [all[]] -Frodo
list: [[Some Tiddler]] Frodo [[Another Tiddler]]
