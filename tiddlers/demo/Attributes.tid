title: Attributes

The attributes of widgets can be updated by Relink, but only if they're whitelisted. Given a whitelisted element/attribute pair, such as `$link` and `to`, the following update could happen:

`<$link to="MyTiddler">A link to my tiddler</$link>`

would update to:

`<$link to="New Tiddler">A link to my tiddler</$link>`

If you have `$list`/`filter` whitelisted and configured as a filter, then the widget `<$list filter="..." />` would have the contents of its filter attribute evaluated, and any whitelisted filter operators inside of it would be considered for updating during a rename operation.

For each element/attribute pair, you must specify its [[type|Types]].
