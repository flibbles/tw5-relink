* Fixed bug where filtered widget attributes might corrupt if reference parameter in nested list cannot be renamed. (i.e. `<$widget attr={{{ [operator{myTitle}] }}} />`. If myTitle can't be renamed, attribute would corrupt.) 
* Relink can handle tricky filtered attribute renames better. Particularly renames involving "}}}".
* Fixed bug where all later filter operators in a run would be reported as containing the target tiddler, even if they didn't.
* Added `<$list emptyMessage />` attribute to core whitelist as wikitext.
* Made it so if a tiddler's title is relinked, all tiddlers that reference it will also be relinked. This doesn't happen in core Relink, but some people need to make plugins where this can happen.
* Added license tab
