\rules except wikilink

* Implemented a little more of v5.3.x features. In this case, the `\widget`, `\function`, and `\procedure` should now be fully implemented.
* Switched all external links in readme, configuration, etc to use target=_blank, so they open the external links in a new tab.
* Relink now looks at definitions in <<tag $:/tags/Global>> as well as <<tag $:/tags/Macro>>.
* Corrected issue where the parameters of locally defined and relink-ready macros were not being reported.
* Corrected issue where filteredtranscludes would not report uses of locally-defined macros.

''Not implemented yet''

* `\parameters` and `<$parameters>` remain entirely unimplemented.
* Probably some esoteric uses of `<$transclude/>` which were introduced in v5.3.0.
