* ''If you're using //Relink-titles//, this release is vital.'' Otherwise this release isn't that important.
* Made minor but highly important change so that Relink-titles can function without deleting countless tiddlers by mistake.
* Revamped the console log results to be more concise, easier to read, simpler, and automatically extensible to plugin material like Markdown, Titles, and others (which weren't logging before)
