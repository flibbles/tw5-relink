* Support for indirect attribute values
* Support for filter attribute values
* better handling for bad transclusion renames (e.g. `tiddlers with !! bangs`)
* Added the [[TextReference field type|https://tiddlywiki.com/static/TextReference.html]]. Probably won't be used too much, but Relink is meant to be a total solution.
* Revamped the popup that appears while renaming tiddlers. Now it accurately lists any tiddlers Relink will be unable to fix.
* Added a ~TiddlerInfo tab which lists all tiddlers that reference the given one.
* //Relink// now should handle all relinking except for macros, which I'm not sure yet how or if I should tackle.
