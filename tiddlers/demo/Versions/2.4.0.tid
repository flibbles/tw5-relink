\rules except wikilink


Other features and fixes

* Some tm-messages are now supported, specifically `tm-new-tiddler` with `$action-sendmessage`.
* Conditionals (i.e. `<% if filter %>`) are now fully supported.
* Added support for `<$transclude $variable />`
* Fixed issue where `\whitespace trim` would cause following `\function` pragma not to relink properly.
