* Configuration page add buttons no longer allow erroneous blanks.
* Form validation for Relink configuration page. It no longer allows illegal input which may cause Relink to behave badly.
* Failed relinks are now reported using Tiddlywiki's alert system, instead of printing to the browser console where no one will see it.
* Improvements to demo site, including macro wikitext parameter example.
* Fixed issue where invalid placeholder macros would cause ~RSoD.
* Fixed issue where unsanitary prettylink captions could corrupt tiddler if downgraded into a widget link.
* Fixed issue where ~WikiLinks could fail in rare circumstances if $tw.config.textPrimitives.unWikilink were changed.
