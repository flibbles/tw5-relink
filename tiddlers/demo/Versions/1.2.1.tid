* Made logging consistent and more clear.
* Demo site explains relink placeholders.
* Prompt about tiddlers that won't be renamed when renaming tiddlers is now fixed, but a better fix is incoming.
* Prettylinks and ~CamelCase links handle strange titles better
* Transcludes handle field and indexes ( `{{tiddler!!field }}` ). It also handles edge cases better.
* Lists will alert when they cannot relink, instead of bungling the operation
* Better error handling
