\rules except wikilink

* Updated macrocall relinking to support new macrocall rule in TW v5.1.24-prerelease. ''Note:'' Without this change, Relink will RSoD a lot on the cutting edge version.
* Changed the plugin library tiddler to not use any language tiddler transclusion, so it can be imported and used by other plugin libraries.
* New default tiddler on demo to brag about my other plugins, like tw5-uglify.
