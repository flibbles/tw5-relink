description: This example module. It's a 3rd party option which didn't come with //Relink-titles// that shows how other plugins can add rename rules of their own. See <<link-to-tab Plugins Plugins/Titles "the //Relink-titles// documentation page">> for more information.
module-type: relinktitlesrule
title: Plugins/Titles/example.js
type: application/javascript

This example module relinks tiddler titles which are prefixed versions of a
renamed tiddler. For example...

    If `fromTitle` is renamed to `toTitle`, then this rule renames
    `$:/TitlesExample/fromTitle` to `$:/TitlesExample/toTitle`.

This is just an example, but core Tiddlywiki will often use prefixes like this
to denote settings related to a tiddler, such as the prefix
`$:/config/EditorToolbarButtons/Visibility/` which corresponds to specific
buttons, and contains settings for their visibility.
