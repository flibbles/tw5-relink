title: Roadmap

This page is meant more for the developer so they don't forget what's left to do.

* Improve UI in configuration menu. Delete buttons shouldn't get that much space. Maybe have examples for each row in gray.
* Macros cached after encountering `<$importvariables>` should be popped after encountering `</$importvariables>`.
* Document the filters included with //Relink//.
* Write tests to confirm relink:references filter, and its interaction with the to-update filter.
** Also, ensure that relink:references works on input and isn't a generator. This may require creating [all[relinkable]]
* Possible issue with `<$importvariables>` widgets being called whose attributes depend on macros defined immediately preceding the widget call. `\define macro() blah\n\n<$importvariables filter=<<blah>> >...`
** And I need to track variables set in `<$set>` even though those aren't ever involved in relinking. They may be part of an importvariables attribute value.
* Better application of wikitext rules in ~WikiRelinking. Pragma first, then block and inline
* macrocall relinker rule doesn't do any logging.
