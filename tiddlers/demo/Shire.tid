title: Shire

The Shire is the home of the hobbits.

After the climax of the series, J.R.R. Tolkien spends another half book covering how <<character Saruman>> trashed the place with union disputes, and then he got stabbed by <<character Wormtongue>>.

A lot of people like the Lord of the Rings, myself included, but there are parts that could have been pared down.
