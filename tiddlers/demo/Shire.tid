title: Shire

The Shire is the home of the hobbits.

After the climax of the series, J.R.R. Tolkien spends another half book covering how Sauron trashed the place with union disputes, and then he got stabbed.

A lot of people like the Lord of the Rings, myself included, but there are some parts that could have been pared down.
